# 🏷️ Name Decision: Dictaat vs Enclave

## 📊 **Option Comparison:**

### **Dictaat.com (Current)**
- **✅ Pros:**
  - .com domain (universal, professional)
  - Already built/established in code
  - Dutch word (local appeal)
- **❌ Cons:**
  - Means "dictation" (sounds authoritarian)
  - Confusing for non-Dutch speakers
  - No connection to location/claiming

### **Enclave.eu (Available)**
- **✅ Pros:**
  - .eu domain (European, professional for Netherlands)
  - Single word, professional
  - Relates to "exclusive territory" (perfect for claiming!)
  - Unique and memorable
- **❌ Cons:**
  - "Aggressive" connotation (enclosed/exclusive groups)
  - Less universal than .com
  - Need to update all branding/code

## 🎯 **Enclave Analysis:**

**"Enclave" actually fits your app PERFECTLY:**
- **Geographic meaning:** "A territory enclosed within foreign territory"
- **Your app meaning:** "Claimed territories within the city"
- **Professional context:** Used in business/real estate
- **Not really aggressive** - just means "exclusive area"

**Examples of positive "enclave" usage:**
- "Luxury enclave" (high-end neighborhood)
- "Tech enclave" (Silicon Valley areas)
- "Cultural enclave" (ethnic neighborhoods)

## 💡 **Alternatives to Consider:**

### **Before Deciding, Check These:**
1. **demesne.com** - Old legal term for land ownership
2. **fief.com** - Historical land holding
3. **vigil.com** - Constant watchful presence
4. **hectare.com** - Land measurement
5. **dictaat.app** - Keep name, change TLD ($20/year)

### **If Enclave.eu Wins:**
- **Tagline:** "Your Exclusive Urban Enclave"
- **App Store:** "Enclave - Claim Your Territory"
- **Domain:** enclave.eu (€15-25/year)

## 🏆 **My Recommendation:**

**Why:**
- ✅ **Perfect semantic fit** (exclusive claimed territories)
- ✅ **Professional single word**
- ✅ **Available .eu domain** (European focus)
