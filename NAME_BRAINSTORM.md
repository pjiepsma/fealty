## 🎯 **Current Name Analysis:**

**"Dictaat" Issues:**
- Means "dictation" (confusing)
- Sounds like "dictate" (authoritarian)
- No connection to location/claiming
- Hard for non-Dutch speakers

**Better Alternative Needed:**
- Clear connection to location/territory
- Professional business sound
- Available domain
- Scalable for future features

## 📝 **My Suggestion:**

**Go with "Territory"** - it's professional, established-sounding, clearly relates to claiming areas, and should have good domain availability.

**Tagline:** "Claim Your Territory. Stay to Own It."
