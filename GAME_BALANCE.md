# ⚖️ Dictaat Game Balance & Naming Discussion

## ⏱️ **Claim Duration Analysis**

### **Current: 5 Minutes Minimum**
**Pros:**
- ✅ Strong differentiator from Turf's instant claims
- ✅ Forces meaningful presence at locations
- ✅ Prevents drive-by gaming
- ✅ Creates real engagement time

**Cons:**
- ❌ Might feel too long for casual users
- ❌ Could be frustrating in bad weather
- ❌ May discourage quick exploration sessions
- ❌ High barrier to entry for new players

### **Alternative Duration Options:**

#### **Option A: 3 Minutes (More Accessible)**
- Faster onboarding
- Still requires presence (not instant)
- Less commitment per claim
- Better for casual play sessions

#### **Option B: 2 Minutes (Competitive)**
- Quick claims for competitive play
- Still anti-drive-by (can't claim while moving)
- Allows more locations per session
- Lower time commitment

#### **Option C: Progressive System**
- Start with 2 minutes for new players
- Increase to 5 minutes for "premium" claims
- Unlock longer durations as rewards
- Balances accessibility with depth

#### **Option D: Location-Based Duration**
- Parks/Museums: 5 minutes (exploration time)
- Restaurants/Shops: 3 minutes (visit time)
- Monuments: 2 minutes (quick stops)
- Adapts to location type

### **My Recommendation:**
**Start with 3 minutes.** It's still meaningful presence but more accessible. You can always increase it later based on user feedback.

## 🏷️ **Name Analysis: "Dictaat"**

### **Current Name Issues:**
- **Dictaat** = "Dictation" in Dutch (not exciting for a game)
- **Dictaat** = "Dictate" (sounds authoritarian, not fun)
- **Confusing meaning** for non-Dutch speakers
- **No clear connection** to exploration/claiming

### **Better Name Suggestions:**

#### **Option 1: Throne/Claiming Theme**
- **ThroneClaim** - "Claim your throne at locations"
- **CrownQuest** - "Quest for the crown"
- **KingClaim** - "Become king of your city"
- **Territory** - "Claim your territory"

#### **Option 2: Exploration Theme**
- **SpotClaim** - "Claim the spots"
- **PlaceKing** - "King of places"
- **LocKing** - "Location king"
- **UrbanThrone** - "Throne of the urban jungle"

#### **Option 3: Dutch/Urban Theme**
- **PlekKing** - "King of spots" (Dutch)
- **StadKing** - "City king" (Dutch)
- **HollandClaim** - "Claim Holland"
- **UrbanClaim** - "Urban claiming"

#### **Option 4: Play on Words**
- **Discaat** - "Discover" + "Dictate" (your suggestion)
- **SpotLight** - "Put locations in your spotlight"
- **ClaimGame** - "The claiming game"
- **Presence** - "Your presence matters"

### **My Top Recommendations:**
1. **ThroneClaim** - Clear, memorable, conveys the king concept
2. **SpotKing** - Simple, explains the concept
3. **UrbanThrone** - Urban exploration + power theme
4. **Presence** - Emphasizes the core mechanic

## 🎯 **Combined Recommendations:**

### **Duration + Name Combo:**
- **3-minute claims** with **ThroneClaim** app
- **Tagline:** "Claim your throne. Stay to reign."

### **Why This Works:**
- 3 minutes is long enough to prevent drive-by but short enough for accessibility
- "ThroneClaim" clearly communicates the king-of-the-hill concept
- Both are adjustable based on user feedback

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy:**

### **A/B Test Durations:**
- **Group A:** 3 minutes
- **Group B:** 5 minutes
- Measure: completion rates, session length, user retention

### **Name Testing:**
- Survey potential users on name preferences
- Test brand recognition and memorability
- Check app store availability

## 📊 **Final Suggestion:**

**Change to 3 minutes** - more accessible while maintaining the anti-drive-by philosophy.

**Change name to "ThroneClaim"** - better brand fit, clearer concept communication.

**Tagline:** "Don't just visit. Claim your throne."
